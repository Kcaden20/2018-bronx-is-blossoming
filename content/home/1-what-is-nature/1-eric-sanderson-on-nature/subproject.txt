Text: “Nature is basically everything. It’s all the elements of the plants and the animals, the living environment, as well as the non-living environment. So, you could talk about nature on Southern Boulevard [in the Bronx]. It’s not like it doesn’t have nature. It has a nature that is very heavily modified by people.”  <br><br>–** Eric Sanderson, Senior Conservation Ecologist, Wildlife Conservation Society**
