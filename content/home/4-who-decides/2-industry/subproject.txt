Text: Every time products are made, transported, used, and discarded, they have an impact on nature.<br><br>We make this thing that we then sell in the marketplace, and [people tend to think] it’s entirely enclosed just in the human sphere. But of course, what is the stuff you’re going to work on? The plastic, or the wood, or the energy? All these things come out of nature. And what happens to the thing after you’ve made it, and you’ve sold it, and somebody doesn’t want it anymore? It goes into the landfill, or the water, and that’s nature.” <br><br>–** Eric Sanderson, Senior Conservation Ecologist, Wildlife Conservation Society**
