Text: Decisions by elected officials can affect how and where people interact with nature.<br><br>“In the case [of building a highway], a twentieth century style plan of separating a low [income] community of color from its waterfront and its parks, is almost 100% a political issue.”<br><br> -**James Chase, VP of Marketing, Majora Carter Group**

Text2: City agencies such as the Department of Parks and Recreation manage what nature looks like and how people interact with it.<br><br>“It’s [called] the Department of Parks and Recreation. People like to play baseball and basketball, and they want places to do that, and parks are generally the places to do those things … There’s constantly this tension between those kinds of planned recreation activities that require dedicated facilities, and nature as a resource.”<br><br> –** Eric Sanderson, Senior Conservation Ecologist, Wildlife Conservation Society**
