Text: “Instead of the South Bronx being the place where the freeways go through and there are people who [struggle] with high asthma rates and poverty, it becomes a place where maybe you take the train instead and maybe you have a great green job and maybe you live a life where you go to work and then maybe you go down to the Bronx River to go fishing. That would be pretty awesome. And it could happen in your lifetime.”<br><br> -** Eric Sanderson, Senior Conservation Ecologist, Wildlife Conservation Society**<br><br>(link:home/links text:Find out how you can get involved! target:_blank)
