Text: “If you look at the historical ecology … for the South Bronx, you can’t believe how much nature was there. Big deep forests, and these wetlands coming up in the valleys, and these rivers coming down […] every valley. Webster Avenue was a stream, and the other streets in the South Bronx all had streams coming down to the East River right there. And there were Native Americans who were living along the shore, and they had this tremendous life. And that was the Bronx for thousands of years.”<br><br> – ** Eric Sanderson, Senior Conservation Ecologist, Wildlife Conservation Society**<br><br>(link: https://www.ted.com/talks/eric_sanderson_pictures_new_york_before_the_city?language=en#t-54928] text: Learn more about New York’s nature in the 1600s! target:_blank)

[City officials] knew that it was eventually going to become a city … so they thought, when we develop the rest of the city, we should make sure we leave some areas for nature and for people to have experiences in green spaces.”<br><br>–** Eric Sanderson, Senior Conservation Ecologist, Wildlife Conservation Society**
