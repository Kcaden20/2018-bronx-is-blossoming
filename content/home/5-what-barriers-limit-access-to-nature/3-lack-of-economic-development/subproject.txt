Text: “Without economic development, locally owned property, and locally owned businesses, you are never really going to get any other kind of green. And by green we mean sustainable … that is more supportive of people and their daily lives, and their quality of life. For instance: putting in trees, putting in greenways, putting in beautiful parks and then adding a layer of coffee shops and economic development.” <br><br>– **James Chase, VP of Marketing, Majora Carter Group**
