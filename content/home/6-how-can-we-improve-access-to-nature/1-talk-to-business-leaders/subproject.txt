Text: “When you&#39;re dealing with industry, learn about their business, learn about their problems, learn about what hurts their business and learn about what helps their business … Don&#39;t just say "Oh, they&#39;re corporate, they&#39;re evil, they&#39;re bad, I don&#39;t care". That may all be true, but they&#39;re not going away. So learn how their business works … and then find out what things you can do to make their lives easier that might also make [community members&#39;] lives easier.”<br><br>– **James Chase, VP of Marketing, Majora Carter Group**
