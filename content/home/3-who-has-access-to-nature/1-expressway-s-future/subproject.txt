Text: “[A] portion of the Sheridan Expressway [will receive] three or four crosswalks and lighted intersections...The actual elevated portion of the Sheridan is not going to be taken down... What is in the Governor&#39;s plan is to add an off and on ramp system that will bring traffic directly off the Sheridan and Bruckner [Expressways] on to Edgewater Road. The problem with that is that on one side is the river and an award-winning park and on the other side is this (link: http://www.sbrwa.org/ text: community target:_blank). So by putting an on and off ramp for trucks mostly, in between where people are and where people ought to be going is not a good move when there is industrial land [nearby] that could be used for that purpose and not disturb people&#39;s access to nature.” <br><br>**–James Chase, VP of Marketing, Majora Carter Group**
