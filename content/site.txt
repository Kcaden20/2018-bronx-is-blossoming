Description: 

In the summer of 2018 CUP, in collaboration with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), partnered with Teaching Artist Hugo Rojas and public high school students from around the South Bronx to investigate who has access to nature and who decides.


Students photographed the neighborhood, rapped about nature, created stop-motion animations, stenciled the area with spray chalk, conducted community surveys, interviewed key stakeholders, and used WCS's Visionmaker.nyc to create digital renderings of what nature in the Bronx could look like in the future. The crew used design and art to break down the information they gathered and teamed up with designer Kevin Cadena to create this website to teach others what they learned and share their visions for nature’s future in the South Bronx!
