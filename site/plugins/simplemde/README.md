This is a textarea with Markdown highlighting using [SimpleMDE](https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor).

![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7975568/33235164-07cf8c6c-d233-11e7-979e-58981a306b7b.gif)

## Installation

Put the `kirby-simplemde-master` folder into your `site/plugins` folder and rename it to `simplemde`.

You can then replace your `textarea` fields with `simplemde` like that:


```
text:
  label: Text
  type:  simplemde
```

## Features

Compared to the built-in textarea, this field has some advantages:

- Live Markdown highlighting. Including green Kirbytags.
- Undo/redo via `Ctrl`/`âŒ˜` + `Z`/`Y`.
- No modals for URLs and email addresses as this prevents the buttons from showing in structure fields.
- Automatic link/email detection when selecting text and using the `link` or `email` button.
- Easy to add custom buttons
- Sticky toolbar on the top for better reachability

## Options

### Buttons

By default the following buttons are displayed:

- `h2`
- `h3`
- `bold`
- `italic`
- `unordered-list`
- `ordered-list`
- `link`
- `pagelink`
- `email`

There are also some more built-in buttons:

- `h1`
- `quote`
- `code`
- `horizontal-rule`

You can define what buttons you want to use for any field:

```
text:
  label: Text
  type:  simplemde
  buttons:
    - h1
    - italic
    - link
```

And you can also globally define default buttons for any SimpleMDE field on your site by setting the `simplemde.buttons` variable in your config.php (Thank you, [rasteiner](https://github.com/rasteiner)):

```php
c::set('simplemde.buttons', array(
  "bold",
  "italic",
  "link",
  "email"
));
```

### Page link

As of version 1.1.2 this field will automatically hide modules and modules container pages with the title `_modules` from the page list. To include them you can add this to your `config.php`:

```
c::set('simplemde.excludeModules', false);
```

### Highlighting

If you don't want to highlight Kirbytags you can add this to your `config.php`:

```
c::set('simplemde.kirbytagHighlighting', false);
```

### Replace core textarea

You can replace the core textarea with this setting in your `config.php`:

```
c::set('simplemde.replaceTextarea', true);
```
