# Bronx is Blossoming
I have been a public access design fellow this year at the Center For Urban Pedagogy. Along with learning how to use art and design for education, I also worked this summer on the City Studies project "The Bronx is Blossoming" which looked closely at Bronx residents' access to nature and their relationship with the Sheridan Expressway. My role was to work with students to create a website that could become a document of the work they had done, all the ideas they'd explored, and also have resources for others. With the students, we worked on a sitemap together, initial wireframes, mockups as well as asset creation for the site—to make sure their personality really came through. The website has a collage and hand-made aesthetic, using photos and drawings made by the studies pasted together to make backgrounds and the objects. Along with this, a custom typeface "DrawnOn" used for the headings was developed to tie into this look and feel.
